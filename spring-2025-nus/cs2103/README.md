# CS2103 - Software Engineering

## Course Description

This course introduces the necessary conceptual and analytical tools for
systematic and rigorous development of software systems. It covers four main
areas of software development, namely object-oriented system analysis,
object-oriented system modelling and design, implementation, and testing, with
emphasis on system modelling and design and implementation of software courses
that work cooperatively to fulfill the requirements of the system. Tools and
techniques for software development, such as Unified Modelling Language (UML),
program specification, and testing methods, will be taught. Major software
engineering issues such as modularisation criteria, program correctness, and
software quality will also be covered.
