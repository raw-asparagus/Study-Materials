\begin{q}{3}
An electron of mass $m$ and charge $-e$ is moving under the combined influence of a uniform electric field $E_0\hat{\vb{e}}_y$ and a uniform magnetic field $B_0\hat{\vb{e}}_z$ . Initially, the electron is at the origin and is moving with velocity $u_0\hat{\vb{e}}_x$. Find the trajectory, $x\paren{t}$, $y\paren{t}$, $z\paren{t}$, of the electron in its subsequent motion.

\noindent\textit{Remark: The general path is called a trochoid which becomes a cycloid in the special case. Cycloidal motion of motion of electrons is used in the magnetron vacuum tube which generates the microwaves in a microwave oven.}
