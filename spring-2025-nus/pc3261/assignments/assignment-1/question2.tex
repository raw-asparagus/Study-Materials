\begin{q}{2}
A particle is projected vertically upwards with speed $u_0$ and moves under uniform gravity in a medium that exerts a resistance force proportional to the square of its speed and in which the particle's terminal speed is $V_{\infty}$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
    \item Find the maximum height above the starting point attained by the particle and the time taken to reach that height.
    \item Show also that the speed of the particle when it returns to its starting point is $\displaystyle \frac{u_0V_{\infty}}{\sqrt{u_0^2 + V_{\infty}^2}}$.
\end{enumerate}
