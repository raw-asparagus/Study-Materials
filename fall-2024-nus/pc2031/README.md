# PC2031 - Electricity & Magnetism I

## Course Description

Among the four fundamental forces in nature, the electromagnetic force has great
technological importance and is critical for the understanding of many subjects
in Engineering and Science. This essential course for Physics majors is intended
for students who wish to acquire a deep understanding of Electricity and
Magnetism. It considers the fundamentals of Electricity and Magnetism and covers
topics such as: electrostatic fields, Coulomb’s law and Poisson’s equation;
magnetostatic fields, Biot-Savart’s law and Poisson’s equation; time-varying
electric and magnetic fields, Faraday’s and generalised Ampere’s laws; Maxwell’s
equations and electromagnetic waves in vacuum. Knowledge from PC2032 is
desirable.
