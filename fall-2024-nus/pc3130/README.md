# PC3130 - Quantum Mechanics II

## Course Description

This course continues from PC2130 and aims to complete basic introductions of
quantum mechanics to physics oriented students. This course will mainly cover
the following: angular momentum albegra, spin, identical particles,
time-independent perturbation theory, variational principle, time-dependent
perturbation theory, and basics of quantum scattering theory, with applications
including the Zeeman effect, atomic fine structure and hyperfine structure,
ground state of the helium atom, the Fermi golden rule, atom in a classical
electromagetic field, stimulated and spontaneous emission, s-wave scattering.
